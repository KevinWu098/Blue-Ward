# RankBot

### A simple Discord.py bot written with RiotWacher and the Riot Games API to track my matches and my friends' League of Legends matches.

Utilizes Replit's built-in database, a Flask development server, and UpTimeTobot to remain online and always watching ðŸ‘€ <sub> (for dirty inters) </sub>.

Current functionality:
- Tracking and untracking of users from Discord.
- Automatic Discord messages whenever a tracked player finishes a match, displaying KDA and a link to their profiles.
