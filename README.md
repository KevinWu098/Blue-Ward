# RankBot

### A simple Discord.py bot written to track my matches and my friend's League of Legends matches.

Utilizes Replit's built-in database, a Flask development server, and UpTimeTobot to remain online and always watching <sub> (for dirty inters) </sub> ðŸ‘€.

Current functionality:
- Tracking and untracking of users
- Automatic Discord messages whenever a tracked player finishes a match, displaying KDA and a link to their profiles.
